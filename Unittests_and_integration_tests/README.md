# Unit Testing in Python

## Overview

Unit testing is a critical part of software development, helping ensure that individual units of code (like functions, methods, and classes) behave as expected. Python provides the `unittest` framework for writing and running tests, which is a built-in library and works out of the box.

This guide will explain how to set up and write unit tests, how to run them, and provide tips on best practices.

## Setting Up Unit Tests

### 1. **Project Structure**

Here's a basic folder structure for a project with unit tests:



### Key Points:
- **How Unit Tests Work**: Unit tests help check individual parts of your code in isolation. By using assertions, you validate expected outcomes and behaviors.
- **Setup**: Tests should be organized in separate test files and grouped logically by functionality.
- **Running Tests**: Use Python's `unittest` module to discover and run tests.
- **Best Practices**: Isolate tests, test edge cases, and use mock dependencies when needed.

Feel free to adapt this `README.md` based on your specific project's structure and testing needs!
